General Questions
-----------------

How to pronounce Xfce ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“Ecks Eff See Eee”

--------------

What does it mean ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name Xfce originally stood for XForms Common Environment, but since
then, Xfce was rewritten twice and doesn't use XForms toolkit anymore.
The name survived, but the F is no longer capitalized (not “XFce”, but
“Xfce”). Currently the abbreviation doesn't stand for anything
(suggestion: X Freakin' Cool Environment). It's not pronounced “X-Face”.
There is no “a” in it.

--------------

What does the logo mean ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A mouse, obviously, for all kinds of reasons like world domination and
monsters and such.

--------------

On which platforms does Xfce run currently?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Xfce is developed to be versatile. It is currently supported on Linux,
Solaris and BSD, but has been known to run in some shape or form on
IRIX, MacOS X, and Windows.

--------------

Under which license is Xfce distributed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Xfce 4 components are licensed under free or open source licenses:
`GPL <https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license>`__ or
`BSDL <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`__ for applications
and `LGPL <https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license>`__ or BSDL for
libraries. Read the documentation, the source code, or the Xfce homepage
for more information.

--------------

How long between two official releases?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no set schedule, but there are goals the developers try to
meet. That said, the creation of deadlines does not lend itself well to
those working without compensation. So the overall goal is to release a
new version as certain goals are reached. Unfortunately, that does not
allow the advanced statement of any release schedule. Please check back
often to read any news releases about the product.

--------------

Where can I find Xfce information/support for my specific distribution?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not able to find support on the `Xfce
Forums <https://forums.xfce.org>`__, you may want to use a site focused,
specifically, on the distribution you are currently running. The
following is not an exhaustive list of Xfce resources.

Distribution Specific Xfce Info/Support Pages:

-  `ArchWiki <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xfce>`__
-  `Debian Xfce <https://wiki.debian.org/Xfce>`__
-  `Fedora Xfce Desktop <https://spins.fedoraproject.org/xfce/>`__

Does Xfce currently support Wayland?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no set schedule, but there are goals defined that the
developers are currently working to meet. See the `Xfce Wayland
Development Roadmap <https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/wayland_roadmap>`__
for details on the short and long-term goals, as well as the status of
`Wayland functionality for the individual
components <https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/wayland_roadmap#component_specific_status>`__.

--------------

[[\|Back To Top]]

Keyboard Related
----------------

--------------

How to configure Shortcuts / Hotkeys / Menu Accelerators ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A number of Xfce applications (Thunar, for example) support the standard
GTK2 way of changing shortcuts: simply hover over the menu option with
the mouse pointer and press the keyboard shortcut you want to rebind it
to.

To delete a keyboard assignment, press the {key>Backspace} key while you
are on the menu entry.

If the shortcut doesn't change, then you need to enable the feature in
GTK+. This can be achieved in 3 ways:

-  If you are running the Xfce desktop environment, enable {gui>Editable
   menu accelerators} in the `User Interface
   Preferences </xfce/xfce4-settings/appearance#menu_and_buttons>`__
   dialog.
-  If you are running GNOME then you can enable {gui>Editable menu
   accelerators} in the {gui>Menu and Toolbars} control center dialog.
-  Otherwise put the following in your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file (create the
   file if it doesn't exist):
   ``gtk-can-change-accels=1``

<note warning>When ``xfsettingsd`` is running you must change the
setting with the Xfce GUI, not through the ``.gtkrc-2.0`` file.</note>

| <note important>This functionality has been disabled since GTK3 which
  means that Xfce apps that have migrated to GTK3 (such as
  xfce4-terminal) do not support it.
| Refer to specific app's documentation to learn how to configure its
  shortcuts.</note>

--------------

Is there some way to call the menu with the keyboard in Xfce?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assign a key with the Keyboard Settings -> Shortcuts to the command
``xfdesktop -menu``. (This does not work reliably since Linux Kernel is
tickless, so xfdesktop -menu needs a fix) The menu will popup where your
mouse is located. You can also use ``xfce4-popup-applicationsmenu`` to
popup the panel menu (also provided by xfdesktop and make sure you have
the plugin in your panel ^\_~).

--------------

Is it possible to focus the Verve plugin with a key?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assign a key to the command ``verve-focus``

--------------

My windows button does not work in the Keyboard Settings > Shortcuts.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The windows button (also known as the superkey) not working as a
modifier is related to the toolkit, GTK+ in the case of Xfce. If you
want to have the windows-key working we recommend you to upgrade GTK+ to
at least version 2.10.0.

--------------

How do I get numlock to start on login?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two possibilities to achieve this. Or you should use a display
manager that turns the numlock on (eg. gdm, check the settings) or you
can use a little program called
`numlockx <https://pkgs.org/download/numlockx>`__, adding ``numlockx``
on in your .xinitrc will do the job.

--------------

Is it possible to use Media keys in the Shortcut Editor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``xmodmap`` to assign keycodes to your Media keys to make them
available for the Xfce shortcut editor:

To determine keycodes of the multimedia keys use the program ``xev``.
Create a ``.Xmodmap`` file in your $HOME directory containing those
keycodes and assign keysyms to them.

Here are some examples of keycodes and their respective keysyms:

::

    keycode 162 = XF86AudioPlay
    keycode 164 = XF86AudioStop
    keycode 160 = XF86AudioMute
    keycode 144 = XF86AudioPrev
    keycode 153 = XF86AudioNext
    keycode 176 = XF86AudioRaiseVolume
    keycode 174 = XF86AudioLowerVolume
    keycode 237 = XF86AudioMedia
    keycode 230 = XF86Favorites
    keycode 236 = XF86Mail
    keycode 178 = XF86WWW

All possible keysyms can be found in ``/usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB`` or
``/usr/share/X11/XKeysymDB``. To ensure that the ``.Xmodmap`` file is
loaded when you start Xfce add ``/usr/bin/xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap`` to
your ``.xinitrc`` or ``.xprofile`` file. When you start the shortcut
editor, the assigned keysyms should show up when you press one of your
multimedia keys. Now it is possible to assign a command to them.

Note: Several problems with auto-loading of ``.Xmodmap`` files at Xfce
startup have been reported (also when issued as autostart command).
Search the Xfce Bugzilla sites for current problems. As a workaround,
run ``xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap`` by hand every time, or try out editing the
somewhat less straightforward xkb configuration files.

--------------

How to determine keycodes with ``xev``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All keyboards are different, keycodes can differ and not everyone has
time to search XKeysymDB file. You can acquire keycodes manually from
your keyboard using the application ``xev``.

In a terminal type the following:

::

     xev | grep -A2 --line-buffered '^KeyRelease' | sed -n '/keycode /s/^.*keycode \([0-9]*\).* (.*, \(.*\)).*$/\1 \2/p'

Next, press the key that you need the keycode from(e.g. When the key
"Stop" is pressed, the output is "174 XF86AudioStop".

--------------

What should I do to change keyboard layout?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several options. One is to use ``xfce4-xkb-plugin``, see `xkb
plugin </panel-plugins/xfce4-xkb-plugin>`__ . You can also use the
``setxkbmap`` command with the two letter keyboard code as argument; you
can edit your X server configuration file to choose a different keyboard
layout (change the value after ``Option "XkbLayout"``, e.g.:
``Option "XkbLayout" "dvorak"``).

--------------

Is it possible to change the default shortcut keys?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, of course. Keyboard shortcuts are defined in two locations. The
shortcuts to handle the window manager are defined in the Settings
Manager > Window Manager Settings > Keyboard. The ``Default`` theme can
not be changed; but, when you add a theme you can change that the theme
you just added.

More global keyboard shortcuts, like volume adjustments, can be found in
Settings Manager > Keyboard Preferences > Shortcuts. Again, you need to
add a new theme before you can start customizing it.

--------------

How can I see a list of all the shortcut keys?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following command, which will produce a nicely formatted text
list to standard output:

::

   xfconf-query -c xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts -l -v | cut -d'/' -f4 | awk '{printf "%30s", $2; print "\t" $1}' | sort | uniq

If you want to put this list into a file, add ``> filename`` at the end
of command.

--------------

How do I make a shortcut that doesn't steal focus?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not currently possible to do this.

[[\|Back To Top]]

--------------

Application Menu
----------------

--------------

The left-click to get the menu on the title bar menu button seems a little slow. How do I change that?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The left-button single-click menu button display speed is linked to the
double click speed. If one wants the menu to appear quicker, just change
the double click speed in the Xfce 4 `Settings Manager Mouse
properties </xfce/xfce4-settings/mouse#behavior>`__ to be faster. Or,
one can right click on the title bar to get the menu displayed almost
instantly without adjusting the double-click speed. The menu will
display both ways.

--------------

How do I display a list of all windows?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two possibilities. The first is by middle clicking on the
desktop (if you have xfdesktop running) or you can add the `window list
plugin <https://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-windowlist-plugin>`__
to the panel (is provided with a ``xfce4-popup-windowlist`` command).

--------------

How to edit the auto generated menu with the menu editor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   cp ~/.cache/xfce4/desktop/menu-cache-name-of-the-generated-file.xml ~/.config/xfce4/desktop/menu2.xml
   cd ~/.config/xfce4/desktop/
   cat menu.xml > menu3.xml
   cat menu2.xml >> menu3.xml
   mv menu.xml menu.orig.xml
   mv menu3.xml menu.xml

Now, you already have a menu with all the categories in the main tree
with some duplicates, but you must first edit ``menu.xml`` with your
favorite editor and remove the 4 following lines in the middle of the
file, otherwise the menu editor will complain about a wrong format:

::

   </xfdesktop-menu>
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE xfdesktop-menu>

   <xfdesktop-menu>

That's all. Now you can run the menu editor, remove the few duplicates
and edit all as you like.

Settings > Desktop > Menu > Menu Editor

Notes: by removing the "system" line, you will remove all the duplicates
menu entries from the auto generated file. So, if it is changed in this
auto generated file, they don't appear anymore, but you will get rid of
most of the duplicates.

To restore the original menu, just do in a terminal:

::

   mv menu.xml menu3.xml; mv menu.orig.xml menu.xml

--------------

What are the exact commands used when launching the 'Settings' applications?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please see `this wiki
entry <https://wiki.xfce.org/mcs-manager_plugin_parameters>`__ for a
list of the precise commands run for each entry under the 'Settings'
menu in a default installation of Xfce4.

[[\|Back To Top]]

--------------

Desktop Manager
---------------

--------------

I want to disable the trash, home and filesystem icons on my desktop, is that possible?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. In Settings > Desktop > Icons > Appearance, select 'None'.

--------------

My Xfce Desktop doesn't have any shortcut icons, why?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can adjust this via Settings > Desktop > Icons > Appearance.

[[\|Back To Top]]

--------------

Panel
-----

--------------

Is it possible to change the icon used by the icon box or task bar for a given application?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's not possible. This setting has to be managed by the application
itself.

--------------

I've installed a plug-in for the panel, but the indicators don't use different colors. What can I do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, try another Gtk theme, since some themes override the color. If
it doesn't solve the problem, you probably have an old ~/.gtkrc-2.0 :
remove it and try again.

--------------

How do I set the panel layer in Xfce 4.2 and 4.4?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to improve focus management this option was removed.

--------------

Is there a world clock applet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to add the `Orage Clock </panel-plugins/orage/start>`__ to the
panel. Then you can middle-click the clock to open the "Global Time"
window, to which you can add any number of clocks.

[[\|Back To Top]]

--------------

Themes
------

--------------

The gtk-xfce-engine themes do not appear in the "user interface" settings dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The gtk-xfce-engine-2 package has to be installed using same prefix as
Gtk2 itself. When installed from sources, the engine is, by default,
installed in /usr/local, while Gtk2 is often installed in /usr. Just
install gtk-xfce-engine-2 again using ``./configure --prefix=/usr``, and
the themes will hopefully become available.

--------------

How can I install new themes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can read everything about changing themes in the `How to install new
themes <https://wiki.xfce.org/howto:install_new_themes>`__ wiki page.See
`Xfce Look <https://www.xfce-look.org/browse/cat/138/order/latest/>`__
for a selection of themes geared towards Xfce/Xfwm4.

--------------

Where can I find additional backgrounds and wallpapers for my desktop?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a selection of `beautiful images </artwork/xfce4-artwork>`__ and
pointers to other sites with `quality,
high-resolution </artwork/xfce4-artwork>`__ images.

[[\|Back To Top]]

--------------

Miscellaneous
-------------

--------------

Why the file chooser is very slow ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is more likely that the icon theme you are using renders too many
SVGs making it very hard to scroll. Switch to another icon theme.

--------------

Why the response to Terminal application is slow?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For NVidia users, add this to your settings:

::

   nvidia-settings -a InitialPixmapPlacement=0 -a GlyphCache=1

For all users, your driver may not support argb visuals very well. You
can disable it for Terminal by exporting the environment variable
XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1. To disable it for Terminal only, put the next
lines inside ~/bin/Terminal for example (given you have a personal bin
directory, you can also put it inside /usr/local/bin):

::

   #!/bin/sh
   XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 /usr/bin/Terminal

--------------

How do I enable panel transparency and window shadows?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable the Composite extension in the X11 config file and make sure
Xfwm4 is compiled with embedded compositor (``xfwm4 -V``).

::

    Section "Extensions"
      Option "Composite" "Enable"
    EndSection

Pay attention: recent versions of X.org turn composite on by default. If
you experience speed problems or any other glitches you have to disable
it explicitly:

::

    Section "Extensions"
      Option "Composite" "Disable"
    EndSection

If you have a reasonably new X.org (7.1, possibly 7.0) and your graphics
card is listed as "supported" at `X.org's EXA status
page <http://www.x.org/wiki/ExaStatus>`__, you should also enable EXA by
adding this line to the card's Device section in your xorg.conf:

::

      Option "AccelMethod" "exa"

Enabling EXA will normally provide a speed increase for compositing and
font rendering, but may cause a small reduction in OpenGL rendering
speed.

Once the Composite extension is activated, go to ``Settings -> Panel``
and ``Settings -> Window Manager Tweaks``.

ATI users (X.org radeon driver)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ATI R3xx/R4xx (9500 to X850, X1050) users may also need this in the
``device`` section for the card:

::

    Option "MigrationHeuristic" "greedy"
    Option "AccelDFS" "true"         # but see radeon(4)
    Option "EnablePageFlip" "true"
    Option "EnableDepthMoves" "true"

nVidia users
^^^^^^^^^^^^

NVidia users may also need this in the ``device`` section for the card:

::

    Option "RenderAccel" "true"
    Option "AllowGLXWithComposite" "true"

Read ``/usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx/README.txt.gz`` (and search for
"RenderAccel" and "AllowGLXWithComposite") to see if they are
recommended at all for your system. At least for recent NVidia GLX
drivers, "AllowGLXWithComposite" "true" is only for X servers older than
X11R6.9.0, and "RenderAccel" "true" is the default setting, and
therefore not required. If you are running a recent NVidia driver and a
recent xorg-server, you do not need these settings (and should not use
the "AllowGLXWithComposite" "true" setting).

--------------

Kiosk - I want to use Xfce in a corporate environment and not let users modify their menu.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use `kiosk mode <https://wiki.xfce.org/howto/kiosk_mode>`__ (see also
`xfce4-session </xfce/xfce4-session/advanced/#kiosk mode>`__ docs).

--------------

How to use a different Window Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please refer to `this manual
page <https://wiki.xfce.org/howto:other_window_manager>`__ for
instructions and caveats regarding the running of a Window Manager other
than fvwm4.

--------------

How to use SCIM in Xfce
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to `this manual <https://wiki.xfce.org/howto:scim>`__

--------------

On Login: When I start Xfce a dialog pops up saying "Could not look up internet address for..."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Xfce simply wants your hostname to be in ``/etc/hosts``. Example input:
``127.0.0.1 localhost``

--------------

On Logout: When I try to log out by pressing the logout button in the panel, I get a dialog asking me whether I want to quit the panel and/or xfce4-session-logout reports that no session manager is running, but it is!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For some reason, your X applications can not connect to the session
manager.

Possible causes are:

-  Your hostname cannot be resolved (see Login problems section).
-  Your home partition or partition containing /tmp is filled up.
-  Your hostname contains non-ascii characters (no umlauts allowed, in
   particular)
-  Either ``~/.ICEauthority`` or ``/tmp/.ICE-unix`` has wrong
   permissions.

Also check ``.xsession-errors`` for clues.

--------------

How can I install a new font in Xfce?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to your `distribution-specific
support <faq#where_can_i_find_xfce_informationsupport_for_my_specific_distribution>`__
as this is handled by your distro and not, specifically Xfce.

--------------

How can I hide the Suspend and Hibernate buttons from the logout dialog?
