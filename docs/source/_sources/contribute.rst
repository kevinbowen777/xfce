How to contribute to Xfce
*************************

Xfce is developed by a small group of hard-working volunteers. There are many ways in which you can contribute to Xfce, all of which are most welcome!

For a more in-depth look at how to contribute to Xfce, it is recommended to read `The Ultimate Contributor's Guide to Xfce <https://andreldm.com/2018/12/03/xfce-contributor-guide.html>`_ for additional helpful information.

If you would like to donate to Xfce, please see the [[start#Donations|Donations]] section.

Bug Reporting and Testing
=========================

One of the most useful tasks that we rely on the community for is testing and reporting of bugs. 

* You can report bugs on `Xfce GitLab site <https://gitlab.xfce.org/>`_

* You can ask on our IRC channel `#xfce on Libera.chat <irc://irc.libera.chat/#xfce/>`_ for help. A `web irc interface <https://web.libera.chat/#xfce>`_ is also available if you don't have an irc client.

* Please do not use the forums to report bugs. 

Before submitting a bug, please try your best to check if it has already been reported. When writing your bug report, try to be as descriptive as possible, but avoid verbosity; Mozilla has a nice guide on `how to write a bug report <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines>`_. 

For more information, see [[.:bugs/start|Bug Reporting and Fixing]].


* For a list of currently open bugs, see the [[:contribute:bugs:bug-summary|open bugs summary]].

If you want to test the current state of Xfce 4.16, you can look at the `Xfce-Test Quick Start Guide <https://wiki.xfce.org/testing/xfce-test>`_, which provides instructions for running a Docker container with the lastest code from git master as well as the ability to run `Behave <https://github.com/behave/behave>`_ (behaviour-driven development) tests.

* As of November 2020, OpenSUSE is now providing a source for "Xfce’s latest builds based on openSUSE’s rolling release Tumbleweed". This is available as a QEMU based virtual machine.  
  
* `Xfce Virtual Machine Images For Development <https://news.opensuse.org/2020/11/23/xfce-raw-images/>`_ provides additional information for its installation and bug reporting instructions.

Development
===========

See the [[:contribute:dev:start|Xfce Development Information]] page for details on getting a contributor's account, working with Git and Xfce source code, and instructions for making releases.
As well check the `Xfce Wiki <https://wiki.xfce.org/>`_ more development hints, tips and tricks.

----

Documentation
=============

The `Xfce Wiki <https://wiki.xfce.org/>`_ and `Documentation <https://docs.xfce.org/>`_ contain many helpful pages that require maintaining and updating with every new release. The wiki is freely available for anyone to edit, refer [[documentation|here]] for information on how to contribute to the documentation.
The `API reference <https://developer.xfce.org/>`_ is automatically updated on a weekly basis based on the latest stable releases.

Financial Contributions
=======================

As of May 2021, Xfce has moved its fiscal hosting to OpenCollective. We are now able to accept financial contributions in both US Dollars as well as Euros. 
If you wish to donate to Xfce in USD or with PayPal, you can do so by visiting `Xfce’s OpenCollective page <https://www.opencollective.com/xfce/donate>`_. Alternatively, if you wish to contribute in Euros, visit `Xfce's s EU OpenCollective page <https://www.opencollective.com/xfce-eu/donate>`_. Every donation is greatly appreciated, but please remember, this is an open source project that is 100% run by volunteers, no one is implicitly obliged to act upon your requests.

Note: For financial contributions to the Xfce (EU) Collective, there is a 6% transaction fee. Additionally, SEPA transfers may take several business days to process and will not appear in the transaction records immediately.

For a list of our supporters and details on individual transactions, see our [[supporters|Supporters page]].

Feature Requests
================

Although the philosophy of Xfce is to find the correct balance between features and lightweight, it is still possible to request new features.

If you plan to request a new feature, please first check on our `issue tracker <https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce>`_ if someone else already filed a request for it. If not, open a new issue and describe your idea in detail. Be warned: You might think your idea is brilliant, but there is a high possibility that there are major downsides.

Obviously, the best way to get your new feature integrated is, to provide a merge request that implements it !

Please note that some components are rather unmaintained, so you might not always get a reply.

----

Translation
===========

Applications, manuals, documentation and many other aspects of Xfce are all translated into different languages. Translations are handled in `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/xfce/public>`_, a web-based translation platform. Visit the [[.:translate/start|translation docs]] to get started with translating.
