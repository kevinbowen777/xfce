===================================

Introduction
------------

Xfce4 Power Manager manages the power sources of the computer and connected devices (wireless mice, keyboards, media players etc.). It also allows users to control the display backlight brightness and set power-saving modes for displays and monitors.\\
In addition, xfce4-power-manager provides a set of freedesktop-compliant DBus interfaces to inform other applications about the current power level so that they can adjust their power consumption, and it provides the inhibit interface which allows applications to prevent automatic sleep actions via the power manager; as an example, the operating systemâ€™s package manager should make use of this interface while it is performing update operations.
